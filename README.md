# ISEPS - Information system for recording student attendace
Final exam project for internet based information systems course. 
Implementation plan:

  - Modules: Logging, Registration, Teaching Subject Management, Starting a New Lecture / New Exercises, Generating a Report.
  - Access control: Admin - review and print reports, account management; Professor - teaching subject management, starting lectures, reviewing reports on their subjects; Assistant - just starting exercises in authorized subjects (i.e. subject that he / she teaches) and reviewing reports from these exercises
  - Data: Student application reports for each subject at the end of the lecture / exercise are displayed (in log format: Name Surname Index no. Application_time), as well as a percentage chart (pie chart) of the total student attendance for the selected subject (lectures / exercises).
  - Acquired data: The date and time of registration of each student's attendance at each lecture / exercise in each subject are collected (planned from the application, but I had entered the demo data manually).
